<details class="question"><summary>What causes hypertrophy</summary><p>Muscular hypertrophy can be increased through strength training and other <span style="color:#64DD17">short-duration, high-intensity anaerobic exercises</span>. Lower-intensity, longer-duration aerobic exercise generally does not result in very effective tissue hypertrophy; instead, endurance athletes enhance storage of fats and carbohydrates within the muscles, as well as neovascularization (creation of new blood vessels).<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>A positive energy balance, when <span style="color:#64DD17">more calories are consumed rather than burned, is required for anabolism</span> (construction of complex molecules) and therefore muscle hypertrophy. An <span style="color:#64DD17">increased requirement for protein, especially branch chained amino acids</span>, is required for elevated protein synthesis that is seen in athletes training for muscle hypertrophy.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Training variables, in the context of strength training, such as <span style="color:#64DD17">frequency, intensity, and total volume also directly affect the increase of muscle hypertrophy</span>. A gradual increase in all of these training variables will yield the muscular hypertrophy.<sup>1</sup></p>
<p>Exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) occurs primarily from the performance of unaccustomed exercise, and its severity is modulated by the type, intensity, and/or duration of training. Although concentric and isometric actions contribute to EIMD, <span style="color:#64DD17">the greatest damage to muscle tissue is seen with eccentric exercise, where muscles are forcibly lengthened</span>.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>Although EIMD can have detrimental short-term effects on markers of performance and pain, it has been hypothesized that the associated <span style="color:#64DD17">skeletal muscle inflammation and increased protein turnover are necessary for long-term hypertrophic adaptions</span>.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p><span style="color:#00BFA5">It is unclear if muscle damage directly causes hypertrophy or if it just happens to coincide with elevated hypertrophy. What is consistent is that exercises which result in muscle damage also result in higher levels of hypertrophy</span>.<sup>5</sup></p>
</details>
<details class="question"><summary>What rep range is best?</summary><p>"Training in a <span style="color:#64DD17">lower rep range (1-5 per set) maximizes strength increases</span>, thereby facilitating your ability to use heavier weights during moderate rep training. In this way, you create greater tension in the muscles, spurring better growth. <span style="color:#64DD17">High reps (15-20 per set), on the other hand, help to increase your lactate threshold</span>.</p>
<p>By delaying the buildup of lactic acid, you stave off fatigue when training in the “hypertrophy range,” (the muscle building range) thus increasing time under tension—another important aspect of the growth process. Bottom line is that optimum muscle development is best achieved by using the full spectrum of rep ranges.</p>
<p>Periodize your program so that it is built around a moderate repetition protocol, but you make sure to include training in both the lower and higher rep ranges."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>There are two types of muscle fibre appropriately named type I and type II. "<span style="color:#64DD17">Type I fibers are maximally stimulated with longer duration sets requiring lower loads, while Type II fibers respond best to short sets with heavy weights</span>."<sup>6</sup> </p>
<p>While type II fibres seem to provide higher levels of hypertrophy during initial training the potential gains available from type I fibres should not be ignored. </p>
<p><span style="color:#64DD17">"The idea that you're sacrificing pounds of muscle by ignoring lighter-load training may seem like an exaggeration, but a quick survey of the fiber-type composition of various muscles may change your mind</span>.</p>
<p>Granted, fiber-type proportion can vary by individual and is influenced by genetics and training (22), but given that many of the major groups have a substantial percentage of type I fibers – on average, humans have a roughly equal amount of fast and slow-twitch fibers – means it may be worth tweaking your approach to optimize slow-twitch fiber growth."<sup>6</sup></p>
<p>"<span style="color:#64DD17">For those who want to maximize their hypertrophic potential, it makes sense to train across the continuum of repetition ranges. While there may be validity to focusing on the so-called "hypertrophy range" (6-12 reps), both high (15-20+) and low (1-5) repetition ranges should also be incorporated into your training program</span>."<sup>6</sup></p>
</details>
<details class="question"><summary>How many sets is best?</summary><p>"Back in the 1970's, Arthur Jones popularized the so-called high-intensity training (HIT, not to be confused with HIIT – high intensity interval training) approach to building muscle.</p>
<p><span style="color:#00BFA5">HIT is based on the premise that only a single set of an exercise is necessary to stimulate growth, provided you train to the point of momentary concentric muscular failure</span>.</p>
<p>According to HIT dogma, performing additional sets beyond this first set is superfluous and perhaps even counterproductive to muscle development.</p>
<p>Other prominent industry leaders such as Mike Mentzer and Ellington Darden subsequently followed Jones's lead and embraced the HIT philosophy, resulting in a surge in its popularity. To this day, HIT continues to enjoy an ardent following.</p>
<p>Now before I get accused of being anti-HIT, <span style="color:#64DD17">I'll readily admit that it's a viable training strategy. There's no denying that it can help build appreciable muscle. And if you're time-pressed, it can provide an efficient and effective workout</span>.</p>
<p>That said, <span style="color:#64DD17">if your goal is to maximize muscle development, HIT simply doesn't do the trick</span>. You need a higher training volume. Substantially higher than just one set per exercise. <span style="color:#64DD17">The prevailing body of research consistently shows that multiple set protocols are superior to single set protocols for increasing strength and size</span>.</p>
<p>Recent meta-analyses published in The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research show that <span style="color:#64DD17">multiple set training results in 46% greater increases in strength and 40% greater increases in muscle growth</span> when compared to single-set protocols.</p>
<p>Whether the hypertrophic superiority of multiple sets is due to greater total muscle tension, muscle damage, metabolic stress, or some combination of these factors isn't clear. <span style="color:#64DD17">What is clear is that multiple sets are a must if you want to maximize your muscular potential</span>.</p>
<p><span style="color:#F50057">Problem is, even if you employ multiple sets it's very possible you're still not training with sufficient volume</span>.</p>
<p>The optimal number of sets needed to elicit superior growth will vary from person to person and depend on a host of individual factors such as genetics, recuperative ability, training experience, and nutritional status.</p>
<p>But individual response is only part of the equation. The size of a given muscle also has relevance. <span style="color:#00BFA5">Larger muscle groups such as the back and thighs need a higher volume than the smaller muscles of the arms and calves, which get significant ancillary work during multi-joint exercises</span>.</p>
<p>Another important consideration here is the structure of your program. All things being equal, training with a split routine allows for a greater daily training volume per muscle group versus a total body routine.</p>
<p>And if you follow a training split, the composition of your split will influence training daily volume (a 3-day split allows for a greater volume per muscle group compared with a 2-day split). Accordingly, training volume is best determined on a weekly basis as opposed to a single session.</p>
<p>Whatever your target weekly volume, optimal results are achieved by taking a periodized approach where the number of sets are strategically manipulated over the course of a training cycle. <span style="color:#F50057">Understand that repeatedly training with high volumes will inevitably lead to overtraining</span>.</p>
<p><span style="color:#F50057">In fact, evidence shows that volume has an even greater correlation with overtraining than intensity</span>. <span style="color:#64DD17">Only by embracing periodization can you reap the benefits of a high training volume while avoiding the dreaded overtrained state</span>.</p>
<p><span style="color:#00BFA5">Here's a periodized strategy that I've found to be highly effective. Let's say you've determined that your maximum weekly volume should entail performing 18-20 sets per muscle group.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#00BFA5">Focus on a three-month mesocycle where you target 8-10 sets a week the first month, 14-16 sets the second month, and then culminate with an overreaching cycle in the final month where you perform 18-20 sets per week.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#00BFA5">Follow this with a brief period of unloading or active recovery to facilitate restoration and rejuvenation. Given that it generally takes one to two weeks for the full effects of supercompensation to manifest after completion of an overreaching cycle, you should realize optimal muscular gains sometime during the restorative period</span>."<sup>4</sup></p>
</details>
<details class="question"><summary>Do I need variety in exercises?</summary><p>"Changing up your exercise selection has a couple of important benefits from a mass-building standpoint. For one, it helps to prevent the so-called “repeated-bout effect” whereby muscles become accustomed to the continual use of the same movements, making them increasingly resistant to trauma.</p>
<p>Staving off such accommodation allows for greater structural perturbations to muscle fibers. That might sound like a bunch of confusing science to some of you, but what it all means is that <span style="color:#64DD17">changing exercises can facilitate increased growth</span>.</p>
<p>What’s more, <span style="color:#64DD17">muscle fibers don’t necessarily span the entire length of a fiber and are often innervated by different nerve branches</span>. Thus, exercise variety alters recruitment patterns in the musculature, ensuring optimal stimulation of all fibers."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>"Employ a diverse selection of exercises over the course of your training cycle. This can be accomplished by switching around modalities, training angles, planes of movement, and even your hand and foot spacing. (<span style="color:#64DD17">For instance, on dumbbell curls, think about holding the handle with your pinky against one end of the bell, and on the next set perform with your thumb against the bell. That slight shift will work your biceps in different ways</span>.)"<sup>3</sup></p>
</details>
<details class="question"><summary>Isolation vs Compound</summary><p>"Multi-joint exercises involve large amounts of muscle and therefore are highly efficient for packing on mass. Alternatively, single-joint exercises allow for greater targeting of individual muscles (or even portions of muscles), enhancing overall growth and symmetry."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>"Structure your routine so that it is comprised of a combination of multi- and single-joint exercises. <span style="color:#64DD17">As a general rule, every workout should contain at least one or two 'big lifts' and a single-joint move</span>."<sup>3</sup></p>
</details>
<details class="question"><summary>Do I need more than just straight sets?</summary><p>"There’s nothing “wrong” with the basic approach; straight sets can and perhaps even should form the foundation of your routine. But it’s also good to mix things up a bit with some specialized techniques.</p>
<p>Supersets (performing one exercise followed immediate by another exercise without rest), drop sets (performing a set to muscular failure with a given load and then immediately reducing the load and continuing to train until subsequent failure) and heavy negatives (performing eccentric actions—the lowering of a weight—at a weight greater than concentric 1-repetition maximum) can be excellent additions to a mass-building routine. <span style="color:#64DD17">They help to induce greater metabolic stress and structural perturbations that can take your muscle growth to new heights. These strategies are particularly effective for advanced lifters who need to “shock” their body to spur greater growth</span>.</p>
<p>Selectively add specialized techniques such as supersets, drop sets, and heavy negatives into your routine. A word of caution: <span style="color:#F50057">these techniques should be considered advanced training strategies. Their fatiguing nature increases the risk for overtraining</span>, and it is therefore wise to limit their use to no more than a few microcycles over the course of a periodized program."<sup>3</sup></p>
</details>
<details class="question"><summary>What about cardio?</summary><p>"A goal of many lifters is to increase muscle development while simultaneously reducing body fat levels. In an attempt to accelerate fat loss, cardio is frequently ramped up while performing intense resistance training. <span style="color:#64DD17">Adding some aerobic training to a muscle-building routine isn’t necessarily a bad thing</span>. <span style="color:#F50057">Overdoing it, however, certainly is</span>.</p>
<p>You see, the signaling pathways for resistance training and aerobic training are contradictory. Some researchers have coined the term “AMPK-PKB switch” whereby aerobic training promotes catabolic processes (AMPK is involved in pathways associated with protein breakdown, which for your sake can be considered “muscle wasting”) and resistance training promotes anabolic processes (PKB is involved in pathways associated with protein synthesis, or for you, “muscle gaining”).</p>
<p>If your goal is to maximize muscle, keep cardio at moderate levels. How much is too much? It ultimately depends on the individual, as some can tolerate more than others. <span style="color:#64DD17">A general guideline is to limit steady state cardio to no more than about 3 or 4 weekly bouts lasting 30 to 40 minutes</span>."<sup>3</sup></p>
</details>
<details class="question"><summary>Metabolic resistance training (burn fat and gain muscle)</summary><p>"MRT, a.k.a. "metabolic resistance training," might as well be called "madman training." It's no-holds-barred, haul-ass, maximum-effort, build-muscle, heave-weight, torch-fat, absolutely insane huff-n-puff training. <span style="color:#64DD17">It'll spike your metabolism, crush calories like beer cans, lift your lactate threshold, boost your ability to make muscle, and maximize your body's capacity for change.</span>"<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>"MRT works by heightening the metabolic "cost" of exercise. This might sound geeky... until you try it. Whereas traditional resistance training might tap 25 or 30% of the body's "change capacity," MRT can maximize your potential for change and unleash metabolic forces that work all day and night.</p>
<p>By maximizing your body's change capacity, <span style="color:#64DD17">you can improve 50%—not 25 or 30%—in only 6 weeks</span>. Even better, MRT spreads improvement across multiple desired targets. Basically, when properly integrated into a periodized-training scheme, MRT can help you build muscle, burn fat and gain strength at the same time."<sup>7</sup></p>
<p>Basically do whole body workouts really fast with minimal rest between sets and taking sets to muscular failure. Read source <sup>7</sup> for more info.</p>

<li><span style="color:#64DD17">1.6-2.2g/kg (varied) protein daily is considered sufficient</span>; there is no detriment to having more (kidney problems only occur in people with already compromised kidney function)<sup>2</sup></li>
<li><span style="color:#F50057">Do not over consume BCAA’s, this may outcompete essential amino acids for absorption</span><sup>2</sup></li>

<details class="question"><summary>Anabolic window</summary><p>There is insufficient evidence to strongly conclude that immediate consumption of protein after a workout has significant benefits. As long as there is protein available for synthesis (ie from a meal taken before the workout) there should be no hinderence to hypertrohpy. There is an elevated window of protein synthesis for around 2-4 hours post workout however excessive consumption of protein will not significantly affect hypertrophy. This elevated window remains slightly elevated for 24-36 hours after the initial 2-4 hour spike. <sup>8</sup> <sup>?</sup></p>
<p>"Due to the transient anabolic impact of a protein-rich meal and its potential synergy with the trained state, pre- and post-exercise meals should not be separated by more than approximately 3–4 hours, given a typical resistance training bout lasting 45–90 minutes."<sup>8</sup></p>
